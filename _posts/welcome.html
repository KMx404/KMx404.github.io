Welcome to my github blog!
Here you'll face different `posts` in many different fields . Since this blog haven't much yet i'll do my best and try to add some good content.
Not all of my posts gonna be just some random shit . I'm gonna add topics and make it something developable if you get what i mean. I'm gonna help you discover new things and make you understand new things that might help you someday! . 
In some point direct you with either some specific code . or some other important content that should be highlighted like this :

```
 Print("Hello World!") 
```
